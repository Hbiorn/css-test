# css-test
reproduce an image as a website landing page
whew lad this was waaay tougher than I thought it would be. I learned a lot of css type stuff in freecodecamp and thought I knew enough of flexbox to be able to reproduce a landing page. Turns out I was very wrong. 

This was a really tough project!! Flexbox is definitely what I struggled with the most, i sorta understood it but I was really just throwing spaghetti at the wall and using process of elimination to figure out the layout. That method did not work great until i started adding flex-direction. that made a huge difference.
